                I'm a passionate Data Engineer with over 3 years of experience transforming complex healthcare data into
                actionable insights. My journey began with a fascination for uncovering patterns in data, which led me
                to specialize in building robust data pipelines and optimization systems.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-pretty text-justify">
                Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with healthcare systems that serve millions of
                patients, where data accuracy and system reliability are paramount. I take pride in my ability to
                improve system performance significantly while maintaining the highest standards of data integrity.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-pretty text-justify">
                When I'm not diving deep into data pipelines or crafting SQL queries, I enjoy exploring the intersection
                of technology and creativity. I believe that the best data solutions come from understanding both the
                technical requirements and the human stories behind the numbers.
